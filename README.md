# JS Products Page

A simple product page built with vanilla JavaScript and no external frameworks. Users can search and filter products based on **name**, **price**, and **category**.

## Features

- Live search by product name  
- Price-based filtering  
- Multiple categories (Tech, Clothing, Health)

This project is a great practice for working with the **DOM and event handling** in JavaScript.
